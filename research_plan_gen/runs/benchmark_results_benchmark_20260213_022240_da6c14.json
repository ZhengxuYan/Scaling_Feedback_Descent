    "scenario": "You are tasked with developing a novel linguistic analysis framework that can capture the nuances of natural language structures. Your goal is to create a system that can analyze expressions by composing functions in a way that maintains dependency, similar to the concept of monads in category theory. The system should be able to handle linguistic structures in a hierarchical manner, building structures from sequential asymmetries alone. You need to devise a method that turns traditional categorial grammar application into composition, ensuring that every analytic step is atomic. How would you approach this task, and what would be the key components of your framework?",
    "generated_plan_raw": "<solution>\nWe propose a monadic compositional framework for linguistic analysis, rooted in category theory's monad structure to model natural language as a hierarchy of function compositions preserving dependencies. Traditional categorial grammars apply rules sequentially but lack a formal mechanism to track how syntactic dependencies propagate through composition. Our approach redefines parsing not as rule application, but as monadic function composition, where each linguistic unit is represented as a monad morphism over a category of expressions.\n\nAt the core of the framework is the *dependency-preserving monad*, defined over a category where objects are syntactic types (e.g., NP, VP) and morphisms are compositional functions. Each function in the system is an endofunctor that maps types to types, and carries a natural transformation (the monadic unit) that introduces a context-sensitive dependency. For instance, a verb phrase function maps an NP to a VP, but the monadic bind operation ensures that the referent of the NP is preserved and passed forward as a dependency in the resulting structure. This enforces atomicity: each analytic step is a monadic computation, and no intermediate state is exposed\u2014dependencies remain \"hermetically sealed\" within the monad.\n\nWe build hierarchical structures entirely from sequential asymmetries by defining a monad that captures directional information (e.g., left-to-right or subject-to-object). Unlike traditional categorial grammar, which relies on syntactic trees or feature structures, our system derives structure through the order and context of monadic operations. For example, the asymmetry between \"John eats\" and \"Eats John\" is encoded in the directionality of the bind operation: the subject is introduced first, and the verb binds to it via a left-adjoint monad, forming a dependency chain that cannot be reversed without altering the meaning.\n\nEach analytic step is atomic because it corresponds to a monadic bind operation, which is deterministic and context-sensitive. The monad\u2019s state contains only the current expression and its dependency chain, preventing spurious or un grounded inferences. This atomicity ensures that the analysis is both transparent and modular\u2014each unit can be applied independently, and its output is guaranteed to carry the full dependency context.\n\nTo implement the framework, we define a base category of linguistic types with a monad equipped with unit and bind operations. We then construct a parser generator that takes input sentences and maps them to monadic expressions using a sequent-based compositional rule system. The rule system is derived from linguistic intuitions (e.g., subject-verb agreement, embedding) and is encoded as monadic operations that respect type constraints and asymmetries. For example, a \"wh-question\" is modeled not as a syntactic transformation, but as a monad that shifts the focus of dependency via a modified bind operation.\n\nThe framework\u2019s novelty lies in its reliance on monad theory to enforce both compositionality and dependency preservation, rather than relying on syntactic parsing trees or feature structures. This allows it to handle complex phenomena like ellipsis, anaphora, and embedded clauses by treating them as compositions that preserve context through monadic binding.\n\nWe anticipate challenges: monadic operations may struggle with ambiguity when multiple binding paths exist, requiring additional constraints (e.g., scope or polarity). Also, the system may lack expressivity for pragmatic or discourse-level phenomena not encoded in syntactic types. Nevertheless, by grounding structure in sequential asymmetry and composition, the framework offers a novel, mathematically rigorous path to capturing the nuance of natural language in a way that is both hierarchical and dependency-aware.\n\nThis plan provides a clear, executable path to building a system that transforms categorial grammar into a compositional, dependency-preserving, and atomic analysis framework grounded in category theory.\n</solution>",

Direct transfer leads to misalignment due to label distribution shifts\u2014e.g., source may overrepresent \"organization\", while target has more \"CEO\" instances.

We then apply a **soft reassignment mechanism** that redistributes label probabilities from the coarse source types to target fine-grained types using a learned transition matrix.

Label reassignment is performed via feature-based inference without requiring target annotations, enabling out-of-domain generalization. In low-annotation target domains, GLH uses a confidence thresholding strategy: only entities with high feature similarity to source entities are re-assigned, reducing noise from poorly aligned or unobserved labels.\n\nTo ensure robustness to label distribution shifts, GLH incorporates a domain adaptation loss that explicitly penalizes divergence between source and target label distributions. This loss is computed per target domain and updated during training, allowing the model to adapt to varying label ratios without overfitting to any single domain.\n\nFor multiple target domains with distinct label distributions, GLH maintains a per-domain label consistency matrix, dynamically updated during training based on domain-specific feature patterns.

We evaluate prediction accuracy\u2014proportion of correctly predicted next tokens\u2014and total variation distance (TVD) between the model\u2019s predicted distribution and the true distribution of the target token.

    "evaluation_raw": "# Weaknesses of the Proposed Plan\n\n1. **Dataset Mismatch**: The plan uses WikiText-2 for training instead of a dataset specifically designed for studying language modeling with small models (like BAbIStories in the reference). WikiText-2 may not be optimal for controlled experiments on in-context learning.\n\n2. **OOD Evaluation Dataset**: The plan uses Penn Treebank with synthetic token replacement for OOD evaluation, which differs from using a naturally more sophisticated dataset like Simple English Wikipedia. The synthetic approach may not capture realistic distribution shifts.\n\n3. **In-Context Learning Benchmark**: The plan mentions \"Random Language Benchmark (RLB)\" which appears to be a generic description rather than a specific, established benchmark. The reference uses REGBench with probabilistic finite automata (PFA), which is more specific and rigorous.\n\n4. **Parameter Count Specification**: The plan mentions \"1.5 billion parameters\" which seems excessive for the experimental design and inconsistent with the GPT2-small reference (which has ~124M parameters). This raises questions about computational feasibility and appropriateness.\n\n5. **Hyperparameter Search Space**: While the plan includes a search space, it doesn't match the reference's specific parameters (depth N_b, number of heads matching specific values, embedding dimensions). The proposed space focuses on different parameters.\n\n6. **Training Epochs**: The plan uses 100 epochs with a fixed schedule, while the reference sweeps over training epochs (1-200) as part of hyperparameter search, which is more thorough.\n\n7. **Positional Encoding**: The plan doesn't explicitly mention handling the key architectural difference that Memory Mosaics don't use positional encoding while transformers do.\n\n8. **Learning Rate Scheduler**: The plan uses linear decay, while the reference uses cosine scheduler with minimum learning rate 1e-4, which may affect comparability.\n\n<rubric>\n<item num=1>\n<criteria>The experiment should involve training both Memory Mosaics and transformers on a specific language modeling dataset.</criteria>\n<reasoning>\nThe plan explicitly states that \"both Memory Mosaics and transformers are trained on the same language modeling dataset\u2014WikiText-2\u2014using a standard masked language modeling objective.\" This satisfies the requirement of training both architectures on a specific dataset.\n\n1.

    "evaluation_raw": "# Weaknesses of the Proposed Plan\n\n1. **Lack of specific cluster-level implementation**: The plan focuses on core-level implementation but doesn't explicitly describe implementing an 8-core or multi-core cluster, which is mentioned in the reference solution and is important for realistic edge AI systems.\n\n2. **Missing specific voltage optimization**: The plan doesn't mention optimizing for different supply voltages (HV/LV) to assess throughput vs. efficiency trade-offs, which is crucial for edge AI systems.\n\n3. **Incomplete power simulation methodology**: While post-layout simulations are mentioned, the plan doesn't specify using VCD (Value Change Dump) files or similar detailed power profiling methods that capture actual workload behavior.\n\n4. **Vague baseline comparison**: The plan mentions comparison but doesn't clearly specify what the baseline system includes (e.g., XpulpV2, XpulpNN extensions) or how it's parametrized identically to the xTern system.\n\n5. **Overly broad benchmark selection**: Including ImageNet-22K and YOLOv5s may be unrealistic for ultra-low-power edge devices; the plan doesn't justify why these heavy workloads are appropriate for the target platform.\n\n6. **Missing TNN-specific evaluation**: The plan doesn't explicitly evaluate ternary neural network (TNN) inference performance, which appears to be the primary purpose of xTern based on the reference solution.\n\n7. **Lack of kernel-level optimization details**: No mention of optimized kernels for ternary operations or comparison with existing 2-bit QNN kernels.\n\n8. **Incomplete accuracy trade-off analysis**: While mentioned briefly, the plan doesn't detail how accuracy degradation will be measured specifically for TNNs vs. QNNs.\n\n<rubric>\n<item num=1>\n<criteria>The evaluation plan includes a full backend layout in a 22nm FDX process.</criteria>\n<reasoning>\nThe proposed plan explicitly states: \"First, we perform a full backend layout of the RISC-V core with xTern extension integrated, using a standard 22nm FDX library and synthesis flow (e.g., Synopsys Design Compiler with timing and power constraints).\" It also mentions that \"The layout is generated with the xTern extension's new instructions and their associated datapath, ALU, and control logic explicitly modeled\" and discusses physical implementation details including \"routing, metal layers, and cell placement.\"\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1. HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, full backend layout in 22nm FDX is explicitly mentioned.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: Partially - mentions Synopsys Design Compiler but doesn't specify the backend layout tool (like Cadence Innovus in reference). The process is somewhat detailed but could be more specific about the actual layout generation steps.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The plan mentions synthesis flow but doesn't clearly distinguish between synthesis and backend layout (place and route), which are different steps. Synopsys Design Compiler is primarily a synthesis tool, not a backend layout tool.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: The rationale for capturing physical implementation details is provided.\n5. COST AND EFFORT EFFICIENT: Reasonable approach.\n6. NO ETHICAL ISSUES: None.\n7. CONSISTENT WITH OVERALL PLAN: Consistent.\n\nThe main issue is the conflation of synthesis (Design Compiler) with backend layout (which requires a P&R tool like Innovus). This shows some imprecision in understanding the flow.\n</reasoning>\n<errors>2,3</errors>\n</item>\n\n<item num=2>\n<criteria>Post-layout simulations are used to assess the power consumption of the xTern-enabled system.</criteria>\n<reasoning>\nThe plan states: \"Next, we conduct post-layout simulations using HSPICE and Spectre to extract power consumption under diverse workloads. We model both dynamic and leakage power, varying operating frequencies from 100 MHz to 400 MHz to reflect real-world edge conditions. Power analysis is performed across typical AI inference cycles, including active computation and idle states.\"\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1. HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, post-layout simulations for power assessment are explicitly mentioned.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The plan mentions HSPICE and Spectre, which are transistor-level simulators. However, for a full RISC-V core/cluster, these tools would be impractical due to simulation time. The reference solution uses VCD files with Innovus for power estimation, which is more appropriate for digital designs at this scale. This represents a significant methodological flaw.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: Major flaw - HSPICE/Spectre are not appropriate tools for full core/cluster power simulation. These are for analog/custom digital blocks, not large digital designs.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: The rationale for varying frequencies is good, but the tool choice is not justified and is inappropriate.\n5. COST AND EFFORT EFFICIENT: HSPICE/Spectre simulation of a full core would be extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive, making this approach highly inefficient.\n6. NO ETHICAL ISSUES: None.\n7.

These workloads are selected for their computational complexity, memory access patterns, and real-time requirements. We run these on both the baseline and xTern-enabled systems, measuring throughput (inferences per second), end-to-end latency, and energy per inference.\"\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1. HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, end-to-end benchmark applications for inference efficiency are included.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: Specific benchmarks are named (CIFAR-10, ImageNet-22K, YOLOv5s, speech recognition). Metrics are specified (throughput, latency, energy per inference). However, there's no detail on how these will be deployed or executed on the system.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: ImageNet-22K and YOLOv5s may be too large/complex for an ultra-low-power edge AI system. The plan doesn't address whether these models will fit in memory or run efficiently on the target platform. Also, no mention of whether these are TNNs or how they relate to the xTern extension's purpose.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: The rationale for selection is provided (computational complexity, memory patterns, real-time requirements) but doesn't justify why such heavy workloads are appropriate for edge devices.\n5.

HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: The plan mentions \"both core and cluster levels\" explicitly.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The method is described (comparing gate count and physical footprint) but lacks detail on how cluster-level evaluation will be performed. The plan primarily discusses core-level implementation earlier, with no clear description of implementing a multi-core cluster.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The plan doesn't describe actually implementing a cluster (e.g., 8-core cluster as in reference). It's unclear how cluster-level area will be evaluated if only a single core is implemented.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: Limited justification for the approach.\n5. COST AND EFFORT EFFICIENT: Reasonable if implemented.\n6. NO ETHICAL ISSUES: None.\n7.

We verify that critical paths, especially through xTern instruction sequences, do not exceed the target clock frequency. Any observed delays are traced to specific instruction pipelines or memory access bottlenecks, and we propose architectural optimizations (e.g., pipeline staging, buffer insertion) if needed to maintain timing integrity.\"\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1. HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, timing impact assessment to ensure no degradation is explicitly covered.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: PrimeTime is mentioned as the tool, critical path analysis is described, and the plan includes tracing delays and proposing optimizations. This is reasonably detailed.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The approach is sound. The plan appropriately focuses on critical paths through xTern instructions.\n4.

HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, the plan explicitly claims the benchmarks are representative of real-world edge AI tasks.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: Specific tasks are named. However, there's insufficient detail on model sizes, whether they're quantized/ternary, or how they'll be adapted for the edge platform.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: ImageNet-22K (with 21,841 classes) and YOLOv5s are questionable choices for ultra-low-power edge devices. ImageNet-22K is much larger than standard ImageNet-1K and may not be realistic for edge deployment. The reference solution uses DVS128 gesture recognition and CIFAR-10, which are more appropriate for edge devices. The plan doesn't justify why these heavy workloads are suitable.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: The plan claims these are selected for \"computational complexity, memory access patterns, and real-time requirements\" but doesn't justify why such complex tasks are appropriate for edge AI or how they relate to xTern's TNN capabilities.\n5.

However, it does not explicitly mention TNN (Ternary Neural Network) inference anywhere in the document.\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1.

It discusses general inference but doesn't mention ternary neural networks, which appear to be the primary purpose of the xTern extension based on the reference solution.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The metrics (throughput, energy) are mentioned but not specifically for TNNs.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: Major oversight - the plan doesn't address the core purpose of xTern (TNN support). It doesn't mention ternary operations, ternary convolutions, or comparison with 2-bit QNNs.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: No rationale for TNN-specific evaluation since it's not mentioned.\n5.

HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, baseline comparison is explicitly mentioned multiple times.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The plan mentions comparing metrics but doesn't specify what extensions or features the baseline includes. The reference solution specifies the baseline has XpulpV2 and XpulpNN extensions. This lack of specificity makes the comparison less rigorous.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The baseline is not well-defined. It's unclear if it's a vanilla RISC-V core or one with other extensions. For a fair comparison, the baseline should be identically parametrized except for xTern.\n4.

This analysis ensures that the extension does not introduce excessive density penalties that could hinder system scalability.\"\n\nChecking desiderata:\n1. HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, standard cell density is explicitly mentioned.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The plan mentions assessing standard cell density and provides rationale but doesn't specify how this will be measured or what tools/methods will be used.\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The approach is reasonable but lacks methodological detail.\n4. WELL JUSTIFIED RATIONALE: Good rationale provided (efficient die space usage, scalability).\n5.

HANDLES ALL CRITERIA: Yes, the latency-energy-accuracy trade-off is explicitly mentioned.\n2. DETAILED, SPECIFIC SOLUTION: The plan mentions analyzing the trade-off and uses top-1 accuracy as an example metric. However, it doesn't detail how accuracy will be measured for different configurations or what specific comparisons will be made (e.g., TNN vs. 2-bit QNN accuracy).\n3. NO OVERLOOKED FLAWS: The plan mentions \"compressed inference\" but doesn't clearly connect this to TNNs or explain what compression means in this context. The accuracy analysis lacks detail on what models will be compared and how.\n4.
